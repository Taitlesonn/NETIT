<p style="position:absolute;top:130px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft01">Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:150px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft01">Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:169px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not&#160;<br/>allowed.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:206px;left:108px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">Preamble</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:229px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft01">The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:249px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04">The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share&#160;<br/>and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#160;<br/>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free&#160;<br/>Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other&#160;<br/>work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:322px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are&#160;<br/>designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them&#160;<br/>if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use&#160;<br/>pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:382px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04">To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the&#160;<br/>rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:&#160;<br/>responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:429px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the&#160;<br/>recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#160;<br/>source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:475px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04">Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and&#160;<br/>(2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:508px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04">For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free soft-<br/>ware. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modifi&#160;ed versions be marked as changed, so that&#160;<br/>their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:555px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04">Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modifi&#160;ed versions of the software inside them,&#160;<br/>although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ free-<br/>dom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals&#160;<br/>to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to&#160;<br/>prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to&#160;<br/>extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:642px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04">Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict&#160;<br/>development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the&#160;<br/>special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the&#160;<br/>GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:702px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft01">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modifi&#160;cation&#160;follow.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:725px;left:108px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">Terms and Conditions</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:748px;left:121px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft03"><b>0. Deﬁ&#160;nitions.</b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:748px;left:204px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft01">&#160;“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. &#160;“Copyright” also means&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:762px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04">copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. “The Program” refers&#160;<br/>to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees”&#160;<br/>and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations. To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all&#160;<br/>or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.&#160;<br/>The resulting work is called a “modifi&#160;ed version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.&#160;<br/>A “covered work” means either the unmodifi&#160;ed Program or a work based on the Program.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:847px;left:121px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft01">&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:847px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04">To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly&#160;<br/>or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer&#160;<br/>or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modifi&#160;cation),&#160;<br/>making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:906px;left:121px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft01">&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:906px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04">To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.&#160;<br/>Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
