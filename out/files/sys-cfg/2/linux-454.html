<p style="position:absolute;top:117px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft01">a)&#160;&#160;The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modifi&#160;ed it, and giving a relevant date.&#160;</p>

This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional&#160;<br/>terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License&#160;<br/>gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission&#160;<br/>if you have separately received it.&#160;</p>

Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause&#160;<br/>this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:486px;left:167px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you&#160;<br/>offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the&#160;<br/>object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is&#160;<br/>covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange,&#160;<br/>for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or&#160;<br/>(2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:571px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft01">c)&#160;&#160;Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the&#160;</p>

Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure&#160;<br/>that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:805px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which&#160;<br/>is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incor-<br/>poration into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall&#160;<br/>be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used”&#160;<br/>refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user&#160;<br/>or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A&#160;<br/>product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial&#160;<br/>or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only signifi&#160;cant mode of use of the product.</p>
