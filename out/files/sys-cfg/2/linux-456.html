<p style="position:absolute;top:72px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is&#160;<br/>reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and fi&#160;nally terminates your&#160;<br/>license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reason-<br/>able means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:130px;left:122px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft00">&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:130px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright&#160;<br/>holder notifi&#160;es you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the fi&#160;rst time you have received&#160;<br/>notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation&#160;<br/>prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:189px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have&#160;<br/>received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not per-<br/>manently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:234px;left:122px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft01"><b>9.&#160;&#160;Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#160;</b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:234px;left:383px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft00">You are not required to accept this License in order to&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:247px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a&#160;<br/>consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&#160;<br/>However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered&#160;<br/>work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or&#160;<br/>propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:319px;left:122px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft01"><b>10.&#160;&#160;Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#160;</b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:319px;left:399px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft00">Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:333px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, sub-<br/>ject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:364px;left:122px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft00">&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:364px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets&#160;<br/>of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results&#160;<br/>from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives&#160;<br/>whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous&#160;<br/>paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in&#160;<br/>interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:450px;left:122px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft00">&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:450px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affi&#160;rmed under this&#160;<br/>License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights&#160;<br/>granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in&#160;<br/>a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or import-<br/>ing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:522px;left:122px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft01"><b>11. Patents.&#160;</b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:522px;left:189px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft00">A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:535px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor ver-<br/>sion”.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:567px;left:122px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft00">&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:567px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor,&#160;<br/>whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by&#160;<br/>this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would&#160;<br/>be infringed only as a consequence of further modifi&#160;cation of the contributor version. For purposes of&#160;<br/>this defi&#160;nition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the&#160;<br/>requirements of this License.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:652px;left:122px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft00">&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:652px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contribu-<br/>tor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#160;<br/>propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:697px;left:122px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft00">&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:697px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however&#160;<br/>denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant&#160;<br/>not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an&#160;<br/>agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:756px;left:122px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft00">&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:756px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of&#160;<br/>the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through&#160;<br/>a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the&#160;<br/>Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefi&#160;t of the patent&#160;<br/>license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this&#160;<br/>License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have&#160;<br/>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your&#160;<br/>recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifi&#160;able patents in that&#160;<br/>country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:882px;left:122px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft00">&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:882px;left:144px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft02">If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by&#160;<br/>procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the&#160;<br/>covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specifi&#160;c copy of the covered work,&#160;<br/>then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and&#160;<br/>works based on it.</p>
